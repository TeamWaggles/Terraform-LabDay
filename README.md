How do I get everything I need installed?

Weâ€™re glad you asked - there are many options to install Terraform. We recommend [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) <br/>
Note: Install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) on MacOS prior to installation of Homebrew. Trust us on this.
